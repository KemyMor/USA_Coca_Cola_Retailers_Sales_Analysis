Conclusion and Insights
Strong Performance in 2023: The dashboard clearly highlights a substantial growth in both sales and operating profit in 2023 compared to 2022.
Top Brands and Retailers: Coca-Cola, Dasani Water, and Diet Coke are leading in terms of sales growth, while FizzyCo and BevCo are the top-performing retailers.
